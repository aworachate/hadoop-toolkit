## The list of add-ons/tools built (or being built) as a part of Hadoop-toolkit project ##
  * Allow performance related health monitoring within Hadoop instead of using heavier JMX based monitoring using Ganglia/nagios etc - [HadoopPerformanceMonitoring](HadoopPerformanceMonitoring.md)
  * Add suggestion-engine for tweaking hadoop default config parameters for better performance - [HadoopPerformanceMonitoring](HadoopPerformanceMonitoring.md)
  * Enhance the suggestion engine to be evolved as an intelligent/expert system for auto-configuration of parameters for repetitive jobs

## The list of some external existing tool kits ##
  * [Ivory](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/ivory/docs/index.html): A Hadoop toolkit for web-scale information retrieval
  * [mrtoolkit](http://code.google.com/p/mrtoolkit/):  Simplify the creation of Hadoop Map/Reduce jobs
